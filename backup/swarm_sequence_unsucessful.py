Version of the AutonomousSequence.py example connecting to 10 Crazyflies.
The Crazyflies go straight up, hover a while and land but the code is fairly
generic and each Crazyflie has its own sequence of setpoints that it files
to.
The layout of the positions:
    x2      x1      x0
y3  10              4
            ^ Y
            |
y2  9       6       3
            |
            +------> X
y1  8       5       2
y0  7               1
